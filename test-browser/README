How to use this:

Make sure you have commandbox 3.3 (or better) installed.
In this test-browser folder, type `box install`.  Let commandbox install testbox.

cd ../loader
ant fast
cd ../test-browser
bash run.sh

It should run a lucee server using the jar you just compiled, and open a browser to the test-browser.

Hit run all.
